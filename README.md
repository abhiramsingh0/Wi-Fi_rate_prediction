# Wi-Fi_rate_prediction
To predict the optimal transmission data rate as selected by the data rate adaptation algorithm in Wi-Fi 

data set contains various network parameters such as link quality, Signal strength....
neural network is used to predict the algorithm behaviour.

Base code is taken from the Machine learning course on coursera by prof. Andrew Ng

Only required funtions are implemented and uploaded here.

The purpose of uploading this project is only for help and not earning any money or any benefit from it.

This project was done as part of Wireless Network course(cs743) in CSE IITBombay.

Code is implemented in MATLAB.
